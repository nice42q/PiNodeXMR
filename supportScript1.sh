#supportScript #1
#This script's purpose is to be held in the PiNodeXMR online repository so as a dev I can aid a user who has a complex issue or customisiation request.
#It is triggered by the selection of supportScript #1 from the setup menu -> system settings -> support scripts
#3 scripts exist to allow for 3 simultanious support requests, each are independant from each other.
#By default this script will do nothing. Once a support request is completed this script will be reverted to default.
#This script does not persist on any users device (it is deleted at the end of initial install and subsequent updates within the cloned PiNode-XMR dir)
